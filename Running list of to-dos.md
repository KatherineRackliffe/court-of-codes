--Document and test as we go!--

Current wave:

- Make all pages pretty (Taylor)
- Make pages consistent design
- Populate databases with ~~more data,~~ dummy data (Katherine, Megan)
      - Less of a priority. We can also add real data (vs dummy data) when funcionality is working properly
      - Dummy data to be added is bookinlist, usertag, userreview
- ~~Implement png functionality (Katherine)~~
- ~~Update documentation to be all lowercase (Taylor)~~
- ~~Update all functions, variables, etc to be all lowercase (Taylor)~~
- ~~Update userListView (Megan)~~
- Get the main components of these pages working and finished on our machines:
  - ~~Welcome,~~ Search (Taylor)
        - Search includes search by author f/l name, title, isbn
  - ~~Home page,~~ book view (Katherine)
        - Book view includes average review, tags, add/remove your reivew, add/remove your tags, add to a list
  - ~~User shelf, list view(Megan)~~
  - ~~Create an account page~~

Next wave: 

- Ensure business rules implemented
- Test on the server
- Make a presentation
- Final once-over to documentation on Box, Github
